# TinyIlvl
This little addon will display the items' level on their frames. No configuration required. It works on inspect frames too, showing inspected average item level.

Color tendencies code:

* Yellow: item's level is around average ilvl.
* Red: item's level is below average ilvl.
* Green: item's level is above average ilvl.
 

Note: color code on inspect frame works comparing each inspected item to your average ilvl.
